## What I did

- Built a basic gem!
- Added behaviors, specifically for structured trained examples
- Added rails controllers and routers which use structured trained examples

## What I learned

- I need to learn more about modules, classes and gem structuring
- Rails Engines is going to be a thing, probably, maybe
- ActiveAI is a boring name. How about something that's more expansive, welcoming, inclusive, social?

## What I could do next

- Run a real example via thinkspawn and get it all working
- Fix active_ai/controller.rb to reflect on the correct detected path name
- Make active_ai/behavior.rb#from_config with a sensible default behavior and test a few others
- Publish v0.1.1
- Update the configuration.rb mechanic a bit
- Load up all OpenAI's examples as instances of one of a couple of behavior types
- Build a chat behavior
- Add session contexts to the router registration so it's flexible
